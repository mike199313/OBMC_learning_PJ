## Introduce Hydra
- Our BMC (Baseboard Management Controller) team just returned from the [ocpsummit22](https://www.opencompute.org/events/past-events/2022-ocp-global-summit) summit held in San Jose, CA. The OCP Summit is the largest of its kind in which participants present new technologies for data centers.
- This year we presented the fruits of a collaboration of Microsoft and Nuvoton to develop an architecture and technology code-named Hydra, comprising Nuvoton's secure BMC solution combined with Microsoft's Root of Trust Cerberus software technology executing on top. 
- Hydra was presented in the OCP Summit security tracks, as well as on the demonstration floor.
- We're looking forward to working with Microsoft's Azure team on new security technologies, further extending the security of data centers.
- You are welcome to view the presentation on Hydra here:
