Subject: [PATCH] Bug 752 - [SW][common][kernel] - Fix MTD partitions were
 deleted due to another flash not found

Symptom/Reaseon:
    We set dual flash in DTS, the aspeed-smc driver will detect them.
    If any of them cannot be detected, the driver will delete the registered one.

    Note that AspeedTech-BMC/linux suggest to use spi-aspeed.c
    But it use DMA feature which would hang in QEMU

Root Cause:
    N/A

Solution/Change:
    If one of the flashes can be detected but another failed then treat it successful.

Entry Test:
    N/A
