Subject: [PATCH 16/31] Add IPv6Only mode support in IPFamilySupport command

Symptom/Reason :
    - Command not working when IP address source is static

Root Cause:
    - Static IP address was not abandoned when switched to another IP addressing family

Solution/Change:
    [phosphor-ipmi-host]
        - Add IPv6Only mode support in IPFamilySupport command
    [phosphor-network]
        - Abandon static IP address when switched to another IP addressing family

Entry Test:
    - Set static IP address
        ipmitool lan set 1 ipsrc static
        ipmitool lan set 1 ipaddr 10.6.0.177
    - Set to IPv6 only mode
        ipmitool raw 0x0c 0x01 0x01 0x33 0x01
    - Check lan config
        ipmitool lan print
